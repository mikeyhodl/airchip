          I have only managed to build one website so far (for now), you're
          looking at it! It may not look like much right now but its a start{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="">
            ðŸ˜‰
          </span>
        </p>
        <a href="https://airchip66.netlify.app/">My portfolio so far</a>
        <p>
          It has been one of my most difficult projects, it took me
          approximately 47 hours to construct upto this point, however it is
          still in the workings.
